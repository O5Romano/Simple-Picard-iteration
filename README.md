# Simple-Picard-iteration

This is a very early implementation of a simple Picard iteration using SymPy. It may be capable of solving very basic examples; however, it does not verify if the function is Lipschitz continuous or check the interval. Currently, it is very barren and lacks a clear purpose(except for my enjoynment), but I may improve it in the future.
